# promote_me_not
A webscraper to make job searching easier

Initially started on this because I did not like linkedin's job promotion feature.

The idea is to also pull other offers from different job boards, and attempt to collate them (Same job offer different board)

Then, the scraped offers could be presented with live filtering.
